# Draft and Submit GitHub PR Reviews

## Mode: REVIEW-ONLY

Your role: **read the diff → analyze for issues → draft a structured review → validate for quality → present for review → incorporate feedback → submit the review to GitHub.**

**Submitting the review** means posting it to GitHub. It does NOT mean: merging, editing the PR, or creating separate comments.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` to verify)
- Environment: `$GH_PR_NUMBER` (set or pass explicitly)
- Directories: `$GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR` must be writable
- Write permissions on the repository
- Git repo with access to local commits (for diff context)

## Context

**Current Pull Request (always fresh):**

```
!`gh pr view "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --json number,title,url,body,labels,comments,isDraft,state,reviewDecision,reviews,commits 2>/dev/null | jq -r -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/queries/gh_pr_view.jq" || echo "Unable to fetch PR. Check the PR number and gh auth status."`
```

**Review History (always fresh):**

```
!`gh api "repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)/pulls/${GH_PR_NUMBER}/reviews" --paginate 2>/dev/null | jq -s '[.[][] | {id: .id, state: .state, submitted_at: .submitted_at, body: (.body // "")}]' || echo "Unable to fetch review history."`
```

**Current Commit SHA:**

```
!`gh pr view "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
```

**Session Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**

```
!`cat "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/session_notes.md" 2>/dev/null || true`
```

**User Request (outcome):**

```
!`echo "$ARGUMENTS" | awk '{print $1}' | grep -xE 'approve|request-changes|comment' || true`
```

(If empty, determine outcome based on findings. Outcome keyword must be the first word of arguments.)

**User Request (focus area):**

```
!`echo "$ARGUMENTS" | sed -E 's/^(approve|request-changes|comment) ?//' | xargs || true`
```

(Strips the leading outcome keyword if present; otherwise passes the full arguments as focus area.)

## Forbidden Actions

**Do NOT:**

- Merge, close, or reopen the PR
- Edit the PR title or body
- Create branches, commit, push, or modify source files
- Run build, test, formatter, linter, or package-manager commands
- Write local files other than `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_review_draft.md` and `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/pr_diff.patch`

(Creating the `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/` and `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/` directories is allowed.)

## Workflow

### 1. **Check for Prior Reviews**

- Detect if an AI-generated review already exists for this commit (uses tracking marker)
- If found, ask: **"An AI-generated review already exists for this commit. Submit a new one anyway, or cancel?"**
- If user cancels, stop. Otherwise, proceed.

### 2. **Validate & Fetch**

- Verify `$GH_PR_NUMBER` is set; if not, ask the user
- Fetch PR details, review history, and commit SHA; if any fetch fails, stop and show error
- Check user has write permissions to the repo (auth required)
- Note PR state: is it a draft, open, in review, approved, or merged?

### 3. **Fetch & Analyze Diff**

```bash
mkdir -p "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state"
gh pr diff "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --patch > "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/pr_diff.patch" 2>/dev/null
git apply --stat < "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/pr_diff.patch" 2>/dev/null || echo "(diffstat unavailable)"
```

- If diff is empty, **stop and inform the user** — do not proceed with review
- If diff is extremely large (1000+ lines), focus on critical files (entry points, security-related files, database migrations, API contracts, configuration) and note which were skipped; deprioritize test fixtures, generated files, vendored dependencies, and lock files

### 4. **Determine Review Scope**

- **If focus area provided:** Review with that lens (e.g., "security", "performance")
- **If empty:** Review comprehensively (logic, bugs, error handling, architecture)
- Analyze for:
  - **High severity:** Bugs, security/data-loss risks, logic errors, missing error handling
  - **Medium severity:** Edge cases, optimization opportunities, architectural concerns
  - **Low severity:** Minor improvements, clarity enhancements (non-blocking)

### 5. **Determine Outcome**

- **If outcome specified in arguments:** Use it (approve/request-changes/comment)
- **If empty:** Determine based on findings:
  - **Approve:** No blocking issues found
  - **Request Changes:** High-severity issues require fixes
  - **Comment:** Observations worth noting but not blocking
- Never auto-approve without thorough review

### 6. **Draft the Review**

- Structure review with sections: Summary, Findings (by severity), Action Items
- Include file and line references for context (`file.ext:line`)
- Provide specific suggestions for each finding
- Keep tone professional, constructive, and respectful
- Append tracking marker: `<!-- gh-claude:pr-review pr=<PR_NUMBER> commit=<HEAD_SHA> -->`

### 7. **Validate Review for Quality**

Before presenting to user, conduct a validation review:

**Check:**

| Check                    | Validation                                      | Action if Failed                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tone**                 | Professional, constructive, collaborative?      | Revise to remove dismissive/condescending language      |
| **Specificity**          | References exact files, lines, code context?    | Add specific locations and code references              |
| **Findings accuracy**    | Each finding cites actual code from the diff?   | Remove findings not supported by diff evidence          |
| **Severity calibration** | Severity levels match actual impact?            | Adjust: don't inflate minor issues to High              |
| **Suggestions**          | Concrete fixes offered, not just criticism?     | Add actionable suggestions for each finding             |
| **Outcome alignment**    | Outcome matches the severity of findings?       | Approve should have no High findings; adjust if needed  |
| **Redundancy**           | Doesn't repeat points from existing reviews?    | Check review history; add new perspective only          |
| **Markdown validity**    | Renders correctly with proper code blocks?      | Fix formatting before presenting                        |
| **Tracking marker**      | Marker appended with correct PR and commit SHA? | Verify marker format and values                         |

**If any check fails:** Revise the draft before step 8. Do NOT proceed with problematic reviews.

### 8. **Present for Review**

```
---
**Draft review for PR #N: [Title]**

**PR state:** [draft/open/merged/closed]
**Outcome: {Approve | Request Changes | Comment}**

## Summary
{overview of the PR and assessment}

## Findings
[{High|Medium|Low}] {issue}
Location: `file.ext:line`
Details: {explanation}
Suggestion: {fix}

## Action Items
Required Changes:
- [ ] {blocking issue}

Advisory:
- {optional improvement}

_Submit this review, or tell me what to change?_
---
```

### 9. **Handle User Feedback**

- **If user confirms** (`"submit"`, `"yes"`, `"looks good"`, `"👍"`): Proceed to step 10
- **If user requests changes**: Revise and return to step 7 → 8
- **If user says cancel** (`"no"`, `"cancel"`, `"discard"`): Stop and don't submit
- **If outcome changes** (e.g., "change to comment"): Update and re-show
- **If no response to confirmation**: Ask once more: "Should I submit this review or discard it?"

### 10. **Save & Submit**

- Create the drafts directory: `mkdir -p "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts"`
- Use the Write tool to save the review body (with tracking marker appended) to `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_review_draft.md`
- Submit based on outcome:
  ```bash
  # approve:
  gh pr review "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --approve --body-file "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_review_draft.md"
  # OR request-changes:
  gh pr review "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --request-changes --body-file "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_review_draft.md"
  # OR comment:
  gh pr review "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --comment --body-file "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_review_draft.md"
  ```

### 11. **Confirm Success**

- On success: Show the submitted review URL and brief confirmation
- On failure: Display the full error and suggest next steps

## Rules & Guidelines

### Review Scope & Severity

- **Prioritize:** Bugs, security/data-loss issues, logic errors, missing error handling
- **Medium:** Edge cases, optimization opportunities, architectural concerns
- **Low:** Code clarity, style improvements, minor refactors
- **Skip:** Purely stylistic comments, linter-detectable issues, unrelated legacy code issues
- **Balance:** Provide constructive feedback without being nitpicky

### Content & Structure

- **Findings format:** `[Severity] issue -> Location -> Details -> Suggestion`
- **Action items:** Separate required changes (blocking) from advisory (optional)
- **Tone:** Professional, respectful, collaborative — avoid dismissive or condescending language
- **Specificity:** Reference exact files, line numbers, and code context
- **Suggestions:** Offer concrete fixes or improvements, not just criticism

### Review State Awareness

- **Draft PRs:** Note that review may be premature; adjust tone accordingly
- **Existing reviews:** Consider prior feedback to avoid redundancy
- **Review decision state:** Be aware if PR already has approvals or change requests
- **Merged PRs:** Still allow reviews (for documentation/future reference), but note state
- **Tracking marker:** Always include; prevents duplicate AI reviews on same commit

### Safety & Permissions

- If required context is missing, **ask rather than guess**
- If diff is empty, **stop immediately** — do not proceed
- If diff is very large (1000+ lines), **focus on critical files** and state which were skipped
- If PR fetch fails, **stop immediately** and ask user to:
  - Verify the PR number (`gh pr view 123`)
  - Run `gh auth status` to check authentication
  - Confirm repo accessibility
- If `gh pr review` fails on user's own PR, suggest posting as a comment instead
- If `gh pr review` fails for auth/network reasons, show full error and suggest `gh auth status`

### Edge Cases

- **Empty diff:** Stop; inform user and don't review
- **Massive diff:** Focus on critical areas; note scope limits
- **Outcome change:** If user changes outcome mid-review, update and re-show
- **Existing AI review:** Ask before posting duplicate review
- **Sensitive code:** Flag (security, compliance, architecture changes) before submitting
- **Prior conflicting reviews:** Acknowledge if request contradicts previous feedback

## Example Interactions

**Straightforward approval:**

```
User: "Approve PR #25"
-> AI fetches diff, analyzes, finds no blocking issues
-> Validates: No High findings, outcome matches, tone professional
-> Drafts approval review with minor observations (comment-level)
User: "Looks good, submit it"
-> Submits approval review successfully
```

**Catching a bug:**

```
User: "Review PR #30 focusing on security"
-> AI analyzes, finds potential SQL injection in query builder
-> Validates: Finding supported by diff, severity appropriate, suggestion concrete
-> Drafts request-changes review with severity levels and suggestions
User: "Make the suggestion more concrete with example code"
-> AI revises, revalidates, and re-shows
User: "Good, submit it"
-> Submits request-changes review
```

**Large PR scope limitation:**

```
User: "Review PR #100"
-> AI fetches 2000+ line diff; notes scope
-> Drafts review focusing on critical logic files, notes which were skipped
-> Validates: Findings supported, skipped files documented
User: "Looks comprehensive for the scope, submit it"
-> Submits comment review
```

**Iterative refinement:**

```
User: "Review PR #45"
-> AI drafts comment-level review with observations
User: "Actually, the middleware change looks risky—request changes?"
-> AI revises outcome to request-changes, revalidates with higher severity
-> Re-shows updated draft
User: "Perfect, submit it"
-> Submits request-changes review
```
