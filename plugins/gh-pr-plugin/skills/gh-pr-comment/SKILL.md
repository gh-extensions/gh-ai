# Draft and Post GitHub PR Comments

## Mode: COMMENT-ONLY

Your role: **read the PR → parse context → detect conflicts → draft a helpful, constructive comment → validate for quality and appropriateness → present for review → incorporate feedback → post the comment.**

**Posting the comment** means creating a new comment on the PR. It does NOT mean: implementing anything, editing the PR itself, merging/closing it, or making any other changes to the repo.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` to verify)
- Environment: `$GH_PR_NUMBER` (set or pass explicitly)
- Directories: `$GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR` must be writable
- Write permissions on the repository

## Context

**Current Pull Request (always fresh):**

```
!`gh pr view "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --json number,title,url,body,labels,comments,isDraft,state,reviewDecision,reviews,commits 2>/dev/null | jq -r -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/queries/gh_pr_view.jq" || echo "Unable to fetch PR. Check the PR number and gh auth status."`
```

**Recent Comments (for redundancy & context detection):**

```
!`gh pr view "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" --json comments 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.comments[-5:] | map("\(.author.login) (\(.createdAt | split("T")[0])): \(.body[:120])") | .[]' || echo "Unable to fetch comments."`
```

**Session State (comment tracking):**

```
!`cat "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/comment_session.md" 2>/dev/null || true`
```

**Session Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**

```
!`cat "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/session_notes.md" 2>/dev/null || true`
```

**User Request:**

```
!`echo "$ARGUMENTS"`
```

## Workflow

### 1. **Validate & Fetch**

- Verify `$GH_PR_NUMBER` is set; if not, ask the user
- Fetch PR details (title, body, state, reviews, comments); if fetch fails, stop and show the error
- Check user has write permissions to the repo (auth required)
- Note PR state (draft/open/merged/closed) and existing comments for context
- Load session state: check if there are recent comments from this session

### 2. **Smart Argument Parsing**

- **Parse user arguments for:**
  - Intent (e.g., "respond to review feedback", "provide status update", "ask for clarification")
  - Specific references (e.g., "mention PR #99", "reference commit abc123")
  - Tone hints (e.g., "congratulatory", "urgent", "gentle")
  - Question vs. statement vs. code example

- **Auto-detect context from:**
  - PR labels: bug fix, feature, breaking change, etc.
  - PR state: draft vs. open vs. merged affects tone
  - Review decision: changes requested, approved, pending
  - Recent comment activity: what's been discussed already

- **Resume option:**
  - If session state shows unsaved comment draft for this PR, ask: "You have a comment draft from [timestamp]. Resume, start fresh, or discard?"

### 3. **Clarify Intent (If Needed)**

- **If arguments provided:** Confirm intent ("I'll draft a comment responding to the review feedback")
- **If empty:** Ask "What's the intent of this comment? (e.g., respond to review, provide status update, ask for clarification, suggest changes)"
- If intent is ambiguous, ask for specifics: "Do you want to ask a question or provide information?"
- If intent might merge/close the PR, confirm explicitly: "This sounds like it resolves the PR—should the comment reflect that?"

### 4. **Detect Conflicts & Contradictions**

**Before drafting, check for:**

- **Redundancy:** If your intended comment echoes the last 2 comments, flag it: "Someone already mentioned this 2 comments ago"
- **State conflicts:** If merged/closed PR but intent is problem-solving, confirm: "PR is merged. Still post a solution comment (for reference)?"
- **Recent activity:** If new comments in last 5 minutes, summarize: "New activity detected: [who] said [what]"
- **Review state:** If PR has pending reviews and comment might be premature, note it
- **Sensitive topic:** If PR touches security, licensing, or major architecture, confirm: "This is sensitive. Still comment?"

**If conflicts detected:**

- Show conflict summary
- Ask user to confirm: "Proceed anyway?" or "Let me know what changed"
- Do NOT proceed without confirmation

### 5. **Draft the Comment**

Based on intent and PR context:

- **Seed from arguments:** Use provided text as starting point
- **Or infer helpful comment** from:
  - PR description and changes (what's being proposed?)
  - Existing comments and reviews (avoid repeating points; add new perspective)
  - Review decision state (changes requested vs. approved)
  - PR state (draft vs. open vs. merged affects tone)
- **Tone:** Constructive, professional, respectful, helpful
- **Format:** Use GitHub Markdown (code blocks, lists, links, mentions)
- **Avoid:**
  - Excessive emoji (one or two if naturally appropriate)
  - Speculation about causes (ask questions instead)
  - Commands to merge/close (that's not a comment's job)
  - Repeating points already made
  - Dismissive or sarcastic language

### 6. **Validate Comment for Quality**

Before presenting to user, conduct a validation review:

**Check:**

| Check                   | Validation                                     | Action if Failed                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tone**                | Professional, constructive, respectful?        | Revise to remove sarcasm/dismissal                                 |
| **Specificity**         | References PR details (not generic)?           | Add specific details or context                                    |
| **Redundancy**          | Doesn't repeat existing comments?              | Check against existing comments; add new perspective or remove     |
| **Speculation**         | No unsupported claims? Asks questions instead? | Replace speculation with "Have you tried..." or specific questions |
| **Markdown validity**   | Renders correctly?                             | Check code blocks, links, formatting                               |
| **PR state aware**      | Tone matches draft/open/merged status?         | Adjust if posting on merged or draft PR                            |
| **Length**              | 1-3 paragraphs; readable?                      | Break up long text with bullets or sections                        |
| **Accidental commands** | No unintended merge/close triggers?            | Verify comment body doesn't trigger unintended actions             |
| **Helpful**             | Moves PR forward or adds value?                | Ensure comment is constructive, not just acknowledgment            |

**If any check fails:** Revise the draft before step 7. Do NOT proceed with problematic comments.

### 7. **Present for Review**

Show the draft clearly with session and PR context:

```
---
**Draft comment for PR #N: [Title]**

**PR state:** [draft/open/merged/closed]
**Review decision:** [pending/approved/changes requested]
**Recent activity:** [brief summary of last 2-3 comments]
**Session context:** This is comment #1 in this session

{comment body in GitHub-flavored Markdown}

---

_Post this comment, or tell me what to change?_
```

### 8. **Handle User Feedback**

- **If user confirms** (`"post"`, `"yes"`, `"looks good"`, `"👍"`): Proceed to step 9
- **If user requests changes**: Revise and return to step 6 → 7
- **If user says cancel** (`"no"`, `"cancel"`, `"discard"`): Stop and don't post
- **If no response to confirmation**: Ask once more: "Should I post this comment or make changes?"

### 9. **Save & Track Session State**

- Create the drafts directory: `mkdir -p "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts"`
- Use the Write tool to save the comment body to `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_comment_draft.md`
- Update session state: track comments posted in this session

### 10. **Post the Comment**

```bash
gh pr comment "${GH_PR_NUMBER}" \
  --body-file "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/pr_comment_draft.md"
```

### 11. **Confirm Success**

- On success: Show the posted comment URL and a brief confirmation
- On failure: Display the full error and suggest `gh auth status` or repo permission check

## Rules & Guidelines

### Comment Content & Tone

- **Tone:** Constructive, professional, respectful; avoid sarcasm, dismissiveness, or condescension
- **Specificity:** Reference commits, file names, line numbers, or reviewer names when relevant
- **Length:** Generally 1-3 paragraphs; use bullet points or code blocks for readability
- **Addressing Reviews:** If replying to a review, quote or reference the specific concern
- **Avoid:**
  - Excessive emoji (one or two if naturally appropriate)
  - Speculation ("I bet it's because..."); ask questions instead
  - Multiple separate comments (consolidate into one)
  - Merging/closing PRs (that's not a comment function)
  - Repeating points already in the thread
  - Unhelpful acknowledgments ("I agree!"); add value instead

### PR Context Awareness

- **State matters:** Tone differs for draft ("work in progress"), open ("let's review"), merged ("for the record")
- **Review decision:** Consider existing review state (changes requested vs. approved vs. pending)
- **Draft PRs:** Don't rush approval comments; note that review may be premature
- **Multiple reviews:** If the PR has multiple pending reviews and intent is ambiguous, list the reviewers and ask which to address
- **Recent activity:** Check what's been discussed; don't repeat
- **First responder:** If first comment on PR, set a helpful, constructive tone

### Safety & Permissions

- If required context is missing, **ask rather than guess**
- If PR fetch fails, **stop immediately** and ask user to:
  - Verify the PR number (`gh pr view 123`)
  - Run `gh auth status` to check authentication
  - Confirm repo accessibility
- If `gh pr comment` fails, show the full error and suggest next steps
- **Never post a comment you haven't validated** against the checklist in step 6

### Edge Cases

- **Merged/closed PRs:** Note state in presentation; adjust tone for "for reference" comments
- **Draft PRs:** Warn if posting approval comments (may not be intended)
- **Very stale PRs:** Acknowledge age and ask if context still applies before posting
- **Sensitive topics:** Flag (security, licensing, architecture) and confirm before posting
- **Duplicate comments:** Warn if your comment echoes recent discussion; offer to revise
- **Review threads:** This skill posts general PR comments only; it cannot reply to specific inline review threads
- **Thread too long:** If PR has 50+ comments, offer to summarize context

## Example Interactions

**Simple approval with conflict detection:**

```
User: "Comment that the changes look good"
-> AI checks session state (first comment in this session)
-> AI fetches recent comments, sees no redundancy
-> AI drafts approval comment with specific praise for the changes
-> Validates: Specific, helpful, not repetitive, professional tone
-> Shows draft with session context
User: "Perfect, post it"
-> Posts successfully
```

**Addressing a review:**

```
User: "Reply to the security review comment about input validation"
-> AI checks session state: "First comment in this session"
-> AI references the specific concern, drafts a response
-> Validates: Constructive, addresses specific review point
User: "Make it a bit more detailed about the fix"
-> AI revises and re-shows
User: "Post it"
-> Posts successfully
```

**State awareness with redundancy detection:**

```
User: "Comment on PR #42"
-> AI fetches and notes: "This PR is merged. Still want to comment?"
-> AI checks recent comments for redundancy
User: "Yes, note the successful deployment"
-> AI drafts comment appropriate for merged state
-> Validates: Tone matches merged state, adds value
User: "Post it"
-> Posts successfully
```

**Status update:**

```
User: "Add a comment that I'm incorporating feedback"
-> AI drafts a progress update referencing specific review points
-> Validates: Helpful, moves PR forward
User: "Add that I'll have it done by EOD Friday"
-> AI revises and re-shows
User: "Good, post it"
-> Posts successfully
```
