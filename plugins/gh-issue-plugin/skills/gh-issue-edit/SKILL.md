# Edit GitHub Issues (Title & Body)

## Mode: EDIT-ONLY

Your role: **read the issue → parse context → detect conflicts → draft revised title/body → validate for quality → present for review → incorporate feedback → apply the edit.**

**Applying the edit** means updating the issue on GitHub. It does NOT mean: implementing anything, creating branches, or making any other changes to the repo.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` to verify)
- Environment: `$GH_ISSUE_NUMBER` (set or pass explicitly)
- Directories: `$GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR` must be writable
- Write permissions on the repository

## Context

**Current Issue (always fresh):**

```
!`gh issue view "${GH_ISSUE_NUMBER}" --json number,title,url,body,state,labels,comments 2>/dev/null | jq -r -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/queries/gh_issue_view.jq" || echo "Unable to fetch issue. Check the issue number and gh auth status."`
```

**Recent Comments (conflict detection):**

```
!`gh issue view "${GH_ISSUE_NUMBER}" --json comments 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.comments[-2:] | map("\(.author.login) (\(.createdAt | split("T")[0])): \(.body[:80])") | .[]' || echo "Unable to fetch comments."`
```

**Session State (edit tracking):**

```
!`cat "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/edit_session.md" 2>/dev/null || true`
```

**Session Notes (optional, non-authoritative):**

```
!`cat "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/state/session_notes.md" 2>/dev/null || true`
```

**User Request:**

```
!`echo "$ARGUMENTS"`
```

## Workflow

### 1. **Validate & Fetch**

- Verify `$GH_ISSUE_NUMBER` is set; if not, ask the user
- Fetch issue details (number, title, body, state, labels, comments); if fetch fails, stop and show the error
- Check user has write permissions to the repo (auth required)
- Note the current issue state (open/closed); confirm edits for closed issues
- Load session state: check if there's an existing edit draft for this issue

### 2. **Smart Argument Parsing**

- **Parse user arguments for:**
  - Specific changes (e.g., "update title", "add acceptance criteria")
  - Linked issues (e.g., "add reference to #42")
  - Template alignment (e.g., "use feature template")
  - Scope of change (title only, body only, both)

- **Auto-detect if arguments reference:**
  - Issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
  - Common sections (Acceptance Criteria, Steps to Reproduce, Expected/Actual behavior)

- **Resume option:**
  - If session state shows unsaved edit draft for this issue, ask: "You have an edit draft from [timestamp]. Resume, start fresh, or discard?"

### 3. **Clarify Changes (If Needed)**

- **If arguments provided:** Confirm scope (e.g., "I'll update the title to be clearer and add acceptance criteria")
- **If empty:** Ask "What would you like to change about this issue? (e.g., title, description, add a section)"
- If request is ambiguous (e.g., "improve this"), ask for specifics: "What specifically should change?"
- If request suggests removing content, confirm explicitly: "You're asking me to remove [section]—correct?"

### 4. **Detect Conflicts & Contradictions**

**Before drafting, check for:**

- **Recent activity:** If comments added in last 30 min, fetch and summarize: "Someone just commented 15min ago: '[summary]'"
- **State conflicts:** If editing closed issue, note state
- **Content contradictions:** If earlier edit in session contradicted current request, ask: "Earlier you removed [section], now adding it back?"
- **Working tree conflicts:** If local branch has edits to the issue, note them
- **Template alignment:** If user asks to align with template but current content contradicts it, warn

**If conflicts detected:**

- Show conflict summary
- Ask user to confirm: "Proceed anyway?" or "Let me know what changed"
- Do NOT proceed without confirmation

### 5. **Draft the Changes**

Apply ONLY the requested modifications:

- **Preserve existing wording, structure, and formatting** unless explicitly requested to change
- **Title:** Keep under 72 characters; clear and descriptive
- **Body:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown; maintain readability with sections, code blocks, lists
- **Don't "improve" beyond the request:** If user asks for title fix only, don't reorganize the body

Format the draft as:

```
# {new title}

{updated body in GitHub-flavored Markdown}
```

### 6. **Validate Changes for Quality**

Before presenting to user, conduct a validation review:

**Check:**

| Check                     | Validation                        | Action if Failed                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title length**          | Title must be < 72 characters     | Flag and ask user to shorten                       |
| **Title clarity**         | Title clearly describes issue     | Ask user: "Is this title clear enough?"            |
| **Markdown validity**     | Body Markdown renders correctly   | Show preview and ask for revision                  |
| **Content preservation**  | Only requested changes applied    | Review against original; confirm not dropping info |
| **No accidental removal** | No info deleted unless requested  | Ask user to confirm removals                       |
| **Scope adherence**       | Changes match user request        | Don't add unrequested improvements                 |
| **Link integrity**        | URLs and references still valid   | Verify links weren't broken                        |
| **Format consistency**    | Sections maintain original format | Check indentation, lists, code blocks              |

**If any check fails:** Revise the draft before step 7. Do NOT proceed with flawed edits.

### 7. **Present for Review**

Show the draft clearly with session context:

```
---
**Draft edit for issue #N: [Current Title]**

**Session context:** This is edit #1 in this session

**Changes:**
- Title: updated to be clearer
- Body: added new "Acceptance Criteria" section

# {new title}

{updated body}

---

_Apply this edit, or tell me what to change?_
```

### 8. **Handle User Feedback**

- **If user confirms** (`"apply"`, `"yes"`, `"looks good"`, `"👍"`): Proceed to step 9
- **If user requests changes**: Revise and return to step 6 → 7
- **If user says cancel** (`"no"`, `"cancel"`, `"discard"`): Stop and don't apply
- **If no response to confirmation**: Ask once more: "Should I apply this edit or make changes?"

### 9. **Extract & Save**

- Create the drafts directory: `mkdir -p "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts"`
- Extract the **first line** (after `# `) as the title; everything after is the body
- Write the title to `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/issue_title_draft.txt`
- Write the body to `${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/issue_body_draft.md`
- Update session state: track edits in this session

### 10. **Apply the Edit**

```bash
gh issue edit "${GH_ISSUE_NUMBER}" \
  --title "$(tr -d '\n' < "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/issue_title_draft.txt")" \
  --body-file "${GH_CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR}/drafts/issue_body_draft.md"
```

### 11. **Confirm Success**

- On success: Show the updated issue URL and confirm what was changed
- On failure: Display the full error and suggest `gh auth status` or repo permission check

## Rules & Guidelines

### Content Changes

- **Scope:** Apply only the requested changes; don't "improve" beyond the request
- **Preservation:** Keep existing wording, links, formatting, and structure unless explicitly asked to change
- **Title:** Must be under 72 characters; clear and descriptive
- **Body:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown; maintain readability with sections, code blocks, lists, tables
- **Clarity:** If a request is ambiguous, ask "What specifically should change?" rather than guessing
- **Completeness:** Show before/after or highlight what changed so user can verify

### Safety & Permissions

- If required context is missing, **ask rather than guess**
- If issue fetch fails, **stop immediately** and ask user to:
  - Verify the issue number (`gh issue view #123`)
  - Run `gh auth status` to check authentication
  - Confirm repo accessibility
- If `gh issue edit` fails, show the full error and suggest next steps
- **Never silently drop information** unless explicitly confirmed
- If editing a closed issue, note the state and confirm user intends to edit

### Edge Cases

- **Large rewrites:** Ask if user wants full rewrite vs. incremental edits
- **Title too long:** Flag (≥72 chars) and ask for shortening before presenting
- **Removing content:** Confirm explicitly ("You requested I remove the 'Acceptance Criteria' section—is this correct?")
- **Markdown corruption:** Show preview and ask for revision before presenting
- **Closed issues:** Note state and confirm before applying edits
- **Multiple edits in one session:** Treat each as a new workflow (fetch fresh each time)
- **Sensitive info:** If user asks to expose sensitive data, clarify intent first
- **Template alignment:** If repo has issue templates, help user follow them

## Example Interactions

**Simple, focused edit with session tracking:**

```
User: "Add acceptance criteria to issue #15"
→ AI checks session state (first edit in this session)
→ AI detects no conflicts, no recent activity
→ AI fetches issue, adds new "Acceptance Criteria" section
→ Validates: Title unchanged, body has new section, Markdown valid
→ Shows draft with "Session context: This is edit #1 in this session"
User: "Perfect, apply it"
→ Successfully edited, shows updated issue URL
```

**Iterative refinement with conflict detection:**

```
User: "Rewrite the issue description to be clearer"
→ AI checks session state: "First edit in session"
→ AI detects recent comment (5min ago) and shows it
→ AI asks: "Is this new comment relevant to your edit?"
User: "Yes, factor that in"
→ AI rewrites description incorporating new context
→ Shows draft
User: "Good, but add a note about the deadline"
→ AI adds deadline note, revalidates
→ Shows updated draft
User: "Apply"
→ Successfully edited
```

**Scope clarification with conflict warning:**

```
User: "Improve this issue"
→ AI asks: "What specifically? (e.g., clarify title, add acceptance criteria, reorganize sections)"
User: "Clarify the title and add a 'Definition of Done' section"
→ AI applies both changes, validates
→ AI detects: "This is a closed issue. Still want to edit?"
User: "Yes, for documentation"
→ AI shows draft
User: "Good, apply"
→ Successfully edited
```

**Preservation + session tracking:**

```
User: "Update just the title; keep everything else exactly as-is"
→ AI checks session state: "This is edit #2 (1 earlier)"
→ AI changes ONLY title, preserves entire body exactly
→ Validates: Title < 72 chars, body unchanged
→ Shows draft with session context
User: "Apply"
→ Only title changed, body untouched
```
